# make-a-deal

This program is a simulation of the Monty Hall problem
where the user attempts to win a car (or a goat) 
by choosing one of three doors.
The player can view their win-loss stats and
see how the odds of winning differ based on 
if they choose to switch doors.
The stats can be cleared, allowing for multiple repeated experiments.

# THE MATHS
If the game is played many, many times,
the player's chances of winning the car 
if they don't switch doors should approximate 1/3
otherwise the chances of winning should approximate 2/3
